1 // What is the function of the secondary memory in a computer?
Secondary memory is used to store data for long periods of time even when power to the computer is gone. Examples of
this are Hard Drives and USB sticks.

2 // What is a program?
"I could find no mention what 'program' meant. That said, I could have just missed it."
A program is set of instructions (source code) that programmers write for the CPU in order to have it perform those
instructions in a language it can understand. ("This is my guess, am I right?")
According to the book: "..the basic sequence of python statements that have been crafted to do something."
("I feel like I was spot on")

3 // What is the difference between a compiler and an interpreter?
An interpreter can process each line of code immediately upon parsing it. A compiler requires the entire file to
process the source code, convert it to machine language and save it as a file (.exe, .dll, etc.,) for future use.

4 // Which of the following contains "machine code"?
The computer hardware contains machine code.

5 // What is wrong with the following code?
>>> primt 'Hello world!'
File "<stdin>", line 1
primt 'Hello world!'
^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
>>>
The print function is misspelled.

6 // Where in the computer is a variable such as "x" stored after the following Python line flashes?
Variables are stored in the main memory (RAM).

7 // What will the following program print out:
x = 43
x = x + 1
print(x)

It will print: (b) 44

8 // Explain each of the following using an example of a human capability: (1) Central processing unit, (2) Main Memory,
 (3) Secondary Memory, (4) Input Device, and (5) Output Device. For example, "What is the human equivalent to a
 Central Processing Unit"?

 (1) The CPU is akin to the human brain.
 (2) Main Memory would refer to short-term memory storage because of it's volatile nature.
 (3) Secondary Memory would refer to long-term memory because we retain it for much longer.
 (4) Input Device could be compared to a spoon because we use it as a tool to help us eat more neatly.
 (5) Output Device could be compared to poop.. I won't go into it.

9 // How do you fix a "Syntax Error"?
Syntax Errors are grammatical errors in the code so to fix it you would need to first find the error and then replace
the misspelled word with the correct spelling.
